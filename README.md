## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later (recommended: Android Studio Flamingo)
- Android SDK 24 or higher (Android 7.0+)
- Kotlin 1.8.20+
- Gradle 8.0+
- JDK 11 or higher

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine
2. Open Android Studio
3. Select "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the `quiz_app` folder
4. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
5. Ensure you have the required SDK versions installed via SDK Manager
6. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

### Building
```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release build
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Install on connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run instrumented tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Generate test coverage report
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```

### Project Setup Verification
To verify the project is set up correctly:

1. **Check Gradle Sync**: Ensure no errors in the Gradle sync
2. **Verify Dependencies**: All dependencies should download successfully
3. **Run Tests**: Execute `./gradlew test` to ensure all unit tests pass
4. **Build Project**: Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` to verify compilation
5. **Launch App**: Install and run on emulator/device

## Dependencies

- **AndroidX Libraries**: Core, AppCompat, Material Design
- **RecyclerView**: For efficient list displays
- **CodeView**: Syntax highlighting for Solidity code
- **Gson**: JSON parsing for lesson data
- **Lifecycle Components**: ViewModel and LiveData

## App Usage Guide

### First Launch
1. **Welcome Screen**: The app opens to the main level selection screen
2. **Level 1 Available**: Only the first level (ERC-20 Token Contract) is unlocked initially
3. **Progress Tracking**: Tap the floating action button to view overall progress

### Learning Flow
1. **Select Level**: Tap on an available level card
2. **View Lessons**: Browse through code lessons with syntax highlighting
3. **Read Explanations**: Each lesson includes detailed explanations
4. **Take Quiz**: Complete the quiz to test your understanding
5. **Progress**: Achieve 70% or higher to pass and unlock the next lesson

### Quiz Types
- **Multiple Choice**: Select the correct answer from 4 options
- **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Complete code snippets by filling in missing parts
- **Code Completion**: Write missing code sections

### Progress System
- **Lesson Completion**: Pass quizzes to mark lessons as complete
- **Level Progress**: Complete all lessons in a level to unlock the next
- **Persistent Storage**: Progress is saved automatically
- **Retry Option**: Failed quizzes can be retaken unlimited times

### Navigation Tips
- **Back Button**: Use device back button or toolbar back arrow
- **Progress FAB**: Quick access to detailed progress from main screen
- **Level Cards**: Color-coded status (Available/Locked/Completed)
- **Lesson Indicators**: Checkmarks show completed lessons

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **App Won't Build**: Ensure all dependencies are downloaded and SDK versions match
2. **Gradle Sync Failed**: Check internet connection and try "Sync Project with Gradle Files"
3. **Emulator Issues**: Use API 24+ emulator with sufficient RAM (2GB+)
4. **Code Highlighting Not Working**: Ensure CodeView library is properly included

### Performance Tips
- **Device Requirements**: Android 7.0+ for optimal performance
- **Memory**: Ensure device has sufficient free storage (100MB+)
- **Network**: App works offline after initial installation
